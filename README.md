- 👋 Hi, I’m @PeopleSoftNotCompany
- 👀 I'm not really sure why anyone would actually be interested in this profile TBH.  I figured I've been doing a ton of coding as of late and while it's pretty basic, I ought to share the fun with others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Physics and dabbling in CS.
- 💞️ I'm not really looking to collaborate
- 📫 How to reach me?  Uh don't.  Please.

- Why the name PeopleSoftNotCompany?
- A. I really like the name PeopleSoft, and while the compnany itself doesn't really exist, I don't want to get in trouble for copyright stuff.
- But yeah People Soft Goes hard.

- Why bother making this?
- A. My own use.  If someone actually manages to get some use out of this I will have succeded.
